# Introduction

This paper aims to determine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Australians’ social lifes in different aspects such as community and family involvements, social trusts, and personal social life by studying the 2020 Australian General Social Survey results on the social experiences questionnaire. The survey result suggests that even though some disturbances are seen on social group activities, non-household family member and friends interactions, the bond with the community and people’s trust in social services providers such as the healthcare system remain strong. This result indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic did not severely damage the social trust in Australia, and that people have confidence in their community to overcome this global crisis.
